## About Me 🚀  

I’m a **junior web developer** with a unique background—trained as a **fighter pilot** and civil engineer, now channelling the same discipline, precision, and problem-solving mindset into **tech and innovation**.  
💡 My journey spans from being the **Best Graduating Student in Civil Engineering** at the Nigerian Defence Academy, to becoming a **Fighter Pilot** with the Nigerian Air Force, and now pivoting into **technology and innovation**.  

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Front-End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)**  
- 🔭 Working on: small but growing **portfolio projects** to sharpen my skills  
- 🌍 Languages: **English** + beginner in **Arabic** (from training in Egypt) + code languages 😉   
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve landed fighter jets, but debugging JavaScript sometimes feels harder!
- 🔭 Aspiring to build **tech startups** that solve real-world problems at scale  
- ✈️ Still serving in active duty, with a long-term vision to bridge **aviation and technology**  

✨ I believe in continuous growth, resilience, and using technology to make the world safer and smarter.
